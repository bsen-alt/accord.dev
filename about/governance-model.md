# Governance Model

Accord operates under a **transparent, meritocratic governance model** designed to balance inclusivity with efficiency. Decisions are made collaboratively, guided by technical excellence, community consensus, and long-term sustainability.

This document outlines how we organize ourselves, make decisions, and empower contributors at all levels.

---

## Core Principles

### Meritocracy

Leadership roles are earned through consistent contributions, demonstrated expertise, and positive impact—not tenure or affiliation.

### Transparency

All major decisions are documented publicly. Discussions happen in open forums like GitHub Issues, Discussions, and public meetings.

### Inclusivity

We strive to include voices from diverse backgrounds, industries, and geographies. Everyone deserves a seat at the table.

### Accountability

Maintainers are responsible for stewarding the project responsibly, ethically, and sustainably.

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role                    | Description                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Contributor**         | Anyone who contributes code, docs, issues, or feedback            |
| **Reviewer**            | Experienced contributors invited to review pull requests          |
| **Maintainer**          | Core team members who merge PRs, cut releases, and guide strategy |
| **Steering Committee**  | High-level oversight body setting long-term direction             |
| **Emeritus Maintainer** | Former maintainers who remain advisors and mentors                |

Each role comes with increasing responsibilities—and influence over the project’s trajectory.

## Decision-Making Process

### Proposals (RFCs)

Significant changes begin as Requests for Comments (RFCs) posted in GitHub Discussions.

An RFC includes:

- Problem statement
- Proposed solution
- Trade-offs considered
- Migration plan (if breaking)

Community reviews and maintains discussion threads until consensus emerges.

### Voting

Most decisions are made by lazy consensus—no objections within 7 days means approval.

For contentious topics, voting occurs among active maintainers:

- Simple majority wins
- Tie-breaker vote held by project lead

Votes are rare but reserved for:

- Breaking changes
- Licensing shifts
- Steering committee elections

### Escalation Path

Disagreements can be escalated to:

1. Lead Maintainer → Mediation
2. Steering Committee → Binding Resolution

---

## Maintainer Lifecycle

### Becoming a Maintainer

Pathway:

1. Active contributor for ≥6 months
2. Nominated by existing maintainer
3. Public call for objections (7-day window)
4. Formal onboarding and mentorship period

Responsibilities include:

- Reviewing PRs
- Cutting releases
- Mentoring new contributors
- Participating in governance discussions

### Stepping Down

Maintainers may step down voluntarily or be removed for inactivity (>6 months) or violation of conduct.

They transition gracefully to **Emeritus** status, retaining advisory privileges.

---

## Steering Committee

Composed of senior maintainers and key stakeholders, the SC provides strategic oversight.

Current Members:

- [Alice Chen](https://github.com/alicechen) – Founder & Lead Architect
- [Bob Rivera](https://github.com/bobrivera) – Engineering Director
- [Claire Kim](https://github.com/clairekim) – Ecosystem Lead

Meetings occur bi-weekly and are open to observers upon request.

Agenda items include:

- Roadmap alignment
- Budget allocation
- Partnership decisions
- Conflict resolution

Minutes are published weekly in GitHub Discussions.

---

## Funding & Sustainability

Funding sources include:

- Corporate sponsorships
- Grants
- Community donations
- Commercial licensing (optional add-ons)

Budget allocation prioritizes:

- Developer time and compensation
- Infrastructure and tooling
- Event participation and outreach

Financial reports are shared quarterly with the community.

---

## Amendments to This Document

Changes to governance require:

- Proposal via RFC
- Lazy consensus or formal vote among maintainers
- Publication of updated version in `accord.dev/about/governance-model.md`

---

## Conclusion

Accord succeeds because of the people behind it—developers, designers, writers, testers, and advocates who believe in better systems.

By embracing openness, accountability, and collaboration, we ensure Accord remains a trusted foundation for secure, governed computing.
